### Creation of Modulo Krinkle Tiling Editor

- **v1.0.0 - Initial Release**
    - Implementation of the Modulo Krinkle Tiling generation engine based on arXiv:2506.07638.
    - Visualization in three modes (Prototile, Wedge, Tiling) and real-time editing of parameters ($m, k, n$).
    - Tiling generation using a front-tracking algorithm and logic for overlap-free, gapless placement.
    - UI featuring dark mode and glassmorphism, with highlighting functionality for each tile row (Depth).

### UI/UX Improvements & Mobile Responsiveness

- **v1.1.0 - Responsive Design & Controls Update**
    - **Mobile Optimization**: Default layout now supports mobile devices. The control panel moves to the bottom on smaller screens.
    - **Toggleable Panel**: Added a hide/view toggle button for the control panel to maximize viewing area.
    - **Enhanced Controls**: Replaced numeric inputs with range sliders for intuitive parameter adjustment ($m, k, t, \text{Rows}$).
    - **Layout Adjustments**: Aligned labels and sliders horizontally for better usability.
